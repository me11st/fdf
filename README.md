hello world!

this is my fdf. It's fully working and rotating! there's one chatch - it doesn't take colors right and probably I'll fix it but it anyway won't mess up your grade :)

It was a though work (this is 4th time I started it, and there are 3 projects that didn't work), and finally it turned out that c# is taking structs in a peculiar way, and you need to be very precise how you calling your struct (I finally called mine through data, as it's *coords there).
may the coding gods be with you :)
